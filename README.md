This presentation was built on [Spectacle Boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplat). The rest of the instructions below are adapted from the original readme.

## Running Locally

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open a terminal and run
```bash
yarn
```
or
```bash
npm install
```
if you're about that life.


Then, to start up the local server, run
```bash
npm start
```

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll.
